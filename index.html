      `"Come not, when I am dead, / To drop thy foolish tears upon my grave, / To trample round my fallen head, / And vex the unhappy dust thou wouldst not save." - Tennyson's meditation on posthumous devotion`,
      `"Strong Son of God, immortal Love, / Whom we, that have not seen thy face, / By faith, and faith alone, embrace, / Believing where we cannot prove." - From In Memoriam, wrestling with doubt and faith`,
      `"I am a part of all that I have met; / Yet all experience is an arch wherethro' / Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades / For ever and forever when I move." - Ulysses, on the infinite nature of experience`,
      `"The woods decay, the woods decay and fall, / The vapours weep their burthen to the ground, / Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath, / And after many a summer dies the swan." - Tithonus, on the burden of immortality`

    const warOfArtQuotes = [
      `"The professional has learned that success, like happiness, comes as a by-product of work. The professional concentrates on the work and allows rewards to come or not come, whatever they like." - Pressfield on detachment from outcome`,
      `"The amateur believes he must first overcome his fear; then he can do his work. The professional knows that fear can never be overcome. He knows there is no such thing as a fearless warrior or a dread-free artist." - On courage vs. fearlessness`,
      `"Resistance's goal is not to wound or disable. Resistance aims to kill. Its target is the epicenter of our being: our genius, our soul, the unique and priceless gift we were put on this earth to give." - The stakes of creative work`,
      `"The counterfeit innovator is wildly self-confident. The real innovator is scared to death." - On authentic versus false creativity`

    const musicProducerQuotes = [
      `"I try to just be a mirror for the artist. My job is to help them see themselves more clearly, not to impose my vision on theirs." - Rick Rubin on ego-less production`,
      `"The studio is an instrument. You have to learn to play it like you would a piano or guitar. Every room has its own voice." - Brian Eno on spatial composition`,
      `"We are not making music. We are making dreams audible." - Quincy Jones on the metaphysical nature of sound`,
      `"The best records are emotional documents of a specific moment in time. Technical perfection is often the enemy of emotional truth." - Daniel Lanois on capturing essence`,
      `"Silence is not the absence of sound, but the presence of possibility." - Arvo Pärt on negative space in composition`

    const quantumTrivia = [
      `The quantum Zeno effect demonstrates that frequent observation can freeze a quantum system's evolution—much like how excessive self-consciousness can paralyze artistic flow.`,
      `Quantum coherence suggests that particles maintain phase relationships across space—paralleling how musical harmonies create meaning through synchronized vibrations across frequency domains.`,
      `Bell's theorem proves that no physical theory based on local hidden variables can reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics—reality itself is fundamentally non-local and interconnected.`,
      `The measurement problem in quantum mechanics reveals that consciousness and physical reality are inextricably linked—the observer participates in creating what is observed.`,
      `Quantum field theory shows that the vacuum is not empty but teeming with virtual particles—even apparent silence contains infinite potential for manifestation.`

    const physiologyFacts = [
      `The auditory cortex processes temporal patterns with microsecond precision, allowing musicians to perceive rhythmic deviations of less than 10 milliseconds—finer than conscious awareness.`,
      `Neural plasticity in musicians shows enlarged corpus callosum, enhanced cross-hemispheric communication, and increased gray matter in motor, auditory, and visual-spatial brain regions.`,
      `The vagus nerve connects emotional states directly to vocal expression—why authentic performance requires genuine feeling, not mere technical execution.`,
      `Proprioception in trained musicians develops extraordinary precision, enabling complex finger movements without visual feedback—the body becomes an extension of musical intention.`,
      `Flow states correlate with decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex (transient hypofrontality)—explaining why peak performance often feels effortless and ego-less.`

    const graphicDesignPrinciples = [
      `Visual hierarchy mirrors musical dynamics—the eye, like the ear, craves tension and release, crescendos and diminuendos in the arrangement of elements.`,
      `Negative space functions like musical rests—not empty, but pregnant with potential, giving shape and breathing room to what surrounds it.`,
      `Color temperature operates on the same principles as harmonic tension—warm advancing, cool receding, creating depth through chromatic push and pull.`,
      `Typography rhythm echoes musical meter—kerning, leading, and spacing create visual beats that can syncopate or align with content's natural cadence.`,
      `Grid systems provide the underlying structure that enables improvisation—like chord progressions, they offer a framework for creative departure.`
